## Executive Summary:

This report presents a Ballerina implementation for routing logic in a default service using an interceptor design pattern. The provided code demonstrates a service with a RequestInterceptor class that intercepts incoming requests and calls a Java InterceptorManager class to handle routing logic. The interoperability between Ballerina and Java is also showcased which allows the program to call java implementation if implemented by the vendor as part of the plugin executor process. Further evaluation is required to ensure the approach is optimal for the intended use case.
